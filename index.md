# Welcome to the bbbalarm project

The Beaglobone Black is a TI Sitara AM3359 ARM Cortex-A8 CPU based evaluation
board with two 40pin 100mil pinsockets. These pinsockets can be used for
additional functionality boards called capes. The bbbalarm cape enhance the
Beaglebone Black by adding coupled and decoupled inputs, that can be used to
supervise an air condition or read out a presence detector.

## License rules

**bbbalarm** is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license version 2 as
provided in the LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0 file.
